# Advent of Code 2024

A collection of my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles solved in Python.

- For downloading the input data and also creating a base template for the solution files, you have to run the `src/main.py` script.
- The script will create a folder for the `current day` and download the input data into the folder.
- For downloading the input data for a specific day, you can run the script with the day number as argument: `src/main.py 1`
- If you want another code as baseline for the daily tasks, you can modify the `src/template.py`!

For downloading your unique input data, you have to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line to it:

```bash
AOC_SESSION = <your unique session cookie>
```
